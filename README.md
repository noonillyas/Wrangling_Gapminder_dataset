This report is aimed to provide an insight into the global population-level health data with the countries available from 1799 to 2016. In this report, we showed the process of curating the GapMinder World Health Data and recreated three interactive charts from a previous report (project 01), such as, bubble chart, growth chart, and rank chart by using the newly created data set, gapminder_df, and provided details of each graph to explain what they depict.
